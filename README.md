# ALX-UDACITY1
### This is the 1st project in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program.
### I investigated a dataset containing details of different movies, the dataset was provided in the course
### This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

### Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
### There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.
### The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.
